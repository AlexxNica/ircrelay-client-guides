## Limechat IRCRelay Set-up Guide

### Get the Client

First, you'll need do download and install [Limechat](http://limechat.net/).

### Adding the Server

You'll be prompted with a welcome screen. You don't need that.

Click "Cancel" and then "Add Server" from the "Server" dropdown menu at the top.

The Add Server screen will look like this:

The Name of the Network is up to you! Since we're setting up a freenode
network, I'm going to call mine IRCRelay Freenode.

Your server and port will match the screenshot.

Make sure to check the SSL Connection box.

Your password is the password you signed up for IRCRelay with.

Unfortunately, we'll need to bypass the check on the client and put in our Nickname. This is the nickname for this specific network.

We will automatically override the rest with the settings you provided when
configuring your network on ircrelay.com.

Make sure to go to the settings page in IRCRelay and varifying the username
for this specific network. It is different then the username you signed up with.

That's it for configuration. Click "Ok".

### Connect

Last but not least, connect to your server by right clicking on "Server" in the top bar and clicking "Connect".
